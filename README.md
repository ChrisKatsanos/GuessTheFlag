# Guess the Flag!!! 
A Small Guess The Flag Game in Python!

A small Python game made with **Turtle Graphics** where you try to guess which country's flag is drawn on the screen.

---

## 🎮 How the Game Works

- The game randomly draws a flag using Turtle.
- You type your guess in the console.
- You start with **3 lives**.
- Each correct answer gives you **1 point** and removes that flag from the pool (so you won’t get the same flag again).
- Each wrong answer removes **1 life**.
- The game ends when:
  - you lose all lives, or
  - you guess all flags correctly.
